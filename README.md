This project contains an example external recommender for the [INCEpTION annotation platform](https://inception-project.github.io/). It is used to recommend possible named entities and part-of-speech tags to an annotator in order to speed up annotation and improve annotation quality. It uses [spacy](https://spacy.io/) internally to do this predictions and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the web framework.

The request format is described in the [INCEpTION external recommender documentation](https://inception-project.github.io//releases/0.6.1/docs/developer-guide.html#_external_recommender).

## Installation

This project uses Python â‰¥ 3.5, `Flask`, `spacy` and `dkpro-cassis`. It is recommended to install these dependencies in a virtual environment:

    virtualenv venv --python=python3 --no-site-packages
    source venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-cassis
    pip install flask
    pip install spacy
    
`spacy` needs a pretrained model. These can be installed by issuing   
    
    python -m spacy download ${MODEL_NAME}
    
from the command line where `${MODEL_NAME}` is the name for the model. A list of pretrained models can be found on the [spacy page](https://spacy.io/usage/models#section-available). Make sure that the model has the capabilities you want, this project needs for instance by default `syntax` for tagging and `entities` for named entity recognition.

## Usage

After everything has been set up, the recommender then can be started from the command line by calling

    python app.py ${MODEL_NAME}
    
When used in production, it is better to deploy this Flask project on an actual application server like [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).
